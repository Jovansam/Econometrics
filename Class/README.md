## General information
- [Course Program](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ST6_icfEsqkSTwHuRO-nk1WTTd5lBsFO/view)
- To follow the class, it is sufficient to read the notes and a textbook, and do the four problem sets, using Matlab or other software of your choice. The assistant, Jacek Barszczewski, (jacek.barszczewski@gmail.com) will be able to help you with Matlab, and he will present TA sessions with Matlab examples. I will be able to help if you use Julia. If you choose not to use Matlab or Julia, please do not expect help with software. Have a look at the problem sets before deciding to use software other than Matlab or Julia, you will need to be able to do those problems.
