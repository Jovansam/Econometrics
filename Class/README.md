## General information
- [Course Program](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ST6_icfEsqkSTwHuRO-nk1WTTd5lBsFO/view)
- to get the notes, go to https://github.com/mcreel/Econometrics, and click on the green Code button at the upper right. Download the notes and example code as a zip file. Decompress it where you like. When using the pdf file econometrics.pdf, the examples in the links should open when you click them. If you would like to run the examples, you need to install julia, and follow the additional instructions on the download page. I don't necessarily recommend doing now unless you have a strong programming background.
- To follow the class, it is sufficient to read the notes and a textbook, and do the four problem sets, using Matlab or other software of your choice. The assistant, Jacek Barszczewski, (jacek.barszczewski@gmail.com) will be able to help you with Matlab, and he will present TA sessions with Matlab examples. I will be able to help if you use Julia. If you choose not to use Matlab or Julia, please do not expect help with software. Have a look at the problem sets before deciding to use software other than Matlab or Julia, you will need to be able to do those problems.
